# pur linux: a simple Linux distro

A minimal, highly extensible, unopinionated Linux distribution with decentrialized package management.

### Why Pur?

There are no objective reasons to use **Pur** over any other distribution, but if you want one which is very minimal, experimental and fully decentrialized and unopinionated, here are our main features:
* busybox
* glibc
* pur package management

### No! Why *Pur*?

No real reason, it sounds nice and it sounds furry*-ish*, and the name [PUR (Pur User Repository)](https://github.com/purlinux/pur-community) sounds very cute.

*ps: i love puro from changed*

### How Pur?
