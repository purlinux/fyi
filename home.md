# pur linux: a simple Linux distro

Pur Linux is a distribution for the x86_64 architecture, focusing on minimalism, extensibility and being unopinionated. The project was founded and created by Daphne Zondervan. 

The distribution is built to be able to run stably on systems, expecting the end-user to maintain the system properly. Pur has no external infrastructure and is fully decentrialized, expecting the end-user to create their own packages if required.

## Why Pur?

There are no objective reasons to use **Pur** over any other distribution, but if you want one which is very minimal, experimental and fully decentrialized and unopinionated, here are our main features:

* Official Repositories - An official repository hosted on GitHub, offering minimal base packages such as `busybox` and `gcc`, focusing to stay as minimal as possible. There are 2 official repositories:
  * Base Repository - Only contains packages such as `busybox` and `gcc`, as minimal as possible.
  * Pur User Repository (Community Repository) - Allows users to submit their own packages, moderated by our maintainers.
* Package Management - A concise, minimal package manager written in the Rust programming language. It's very portable using `shell` scripts for installing, updating, etc.

## No! Why *Pur*?

No real reason, it sounds nice and it sounds furry*-ish*, and the name [PUR (Pur User Repository)](https://github.com/purlinux/pur-community) sounds very cute.
*ps: i love puro from changed*
